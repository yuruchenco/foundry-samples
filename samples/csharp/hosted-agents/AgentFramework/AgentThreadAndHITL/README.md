# What this sample demonstrates

This sample demonstrates how to use AI agents as executors within a workflow, hosted using
[Azure AI AgentServer SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/overview/azure/ai.agentserver.agentframework-readme) and
deploy it to Microsoft Foundry using the Azure Developer CLI [ai agent](https://aka.ms/azdaiagent/docs) extension.

## How It Works

### Weather Assistant Agent

This sample demonstrates the integration of AI agents with a function tool involving human approval.

The agents are connected sequentially in a workflow, creating a translation chain that demonstrates:

- How AgentServer adapter use a ThreadRepository to manage conversation history.
- The AgentServer adapter converts human approval request to a FunctionCall with function name `__hosted_agent_adapter_hitl__`
- User approve or deny the request by responding `approved` or `denied` as a FunctionCallOutput.

### Agent Hosting

The agent workflow is hosted using the [Azure AI AgentServer SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/overview/azure/ai.agentserver.agentframework-readme),
which provisions a REST API endpoint compatible with the OpenAI Responses protocol. This allows interaction with the agent workflow using OpenAI Responses compatible clients.

### Agent Deployment

The hosted agent workflow can be seamlessly deployed to Microsoft Foundry using the Azure Developer CLI [ai agent](https://aka.ms/azdaiagent/docs) extension.
The extension builds a container image for the agent, deploys it to Azure Container Instances (ACI), and creates a hosted agent version and deployment on Foundry Agent Service.

## Running the Agent Locally

### Prerequisites

Before running this sample, ensure you have:

1. An Azure OpenAI endpoint configured
2. A deployment of a chat model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`)
3. Azure CLI installed and authenticated (`az login`)
4. .NET 9.0 SDK or later installed

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables:

- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` - Your Azure OpenAI endpoint URL (required)
- `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` - The deployment name for your chat model (optional, defaults to `gpt-4o-mini`)

**PowerShell:**

```powershell
# Replace with your Azure OpenAI endpoint
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://your-openai-resource.openai.azure.com/"

# Optional, defaults to gpt-4o-mini
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="gpt-4o-mini"
```

### Running the Sample

To run the agent, execute the following command in your terminal:

```powershell
dotnet run
```

This will start the hosted agent workflow locally on `http://localhost:8088/`.

### Interacting with the Agent

You can interact with the agent workflow using:

- The `test_requests.py` file in this directory to test and prompt the agent. It now generates a valid `conversation.id` automatically and reuses it across turns.
- Any OpenAI Responses compatible client by sending requests to `http://localhost:8088/`. For this HITL sample, you must provide a stable `conversation.id` in every request (including the first one) to keep thread state and pending approvals.

Try providing text to ask the weather assistant agent about the weather in a city.

### Deploying the Agent to Microsoft Foundry

To deploy your agent to Microsoft Foundry, follow the comprehensive deployment guide at https://aka.ms/azdaiagent/docs

## Troubleshooting

### Images built on Apple Silicon or other ARM64 machines do not work on our service

We **recommend using `azd` cloud build**, which always builds images with the correct architecture.

If you choose to **build locally**, and your machine is **not `linux/amd64`** (for example, an Apple Silicon Mac), the image will **not be compatible with our service**, causing runtime failures.

**Fix for local builds**

Add this line at the top of your `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM --platform=linux/amd64 python:3.12-slim
```

This forces the image to be built for the required `amd64` architecture.
